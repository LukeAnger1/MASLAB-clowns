# Whenever you make changes make sure to run the below in the dev folder

## colcon build

# This will build the project so it can run (if you change the code but dont rebuild your changes wont take effect)

# IMPORTANT NOTE:
# Before running any ros2 command you need to run the below in your terminal (if you make a new terminal you need to do this again)

## source install/setup.bash

## ros2 launch image_processing image_processing_launch.py 

## ros2 launch motor_control motor_control_launch.py 

# Done: Below is OLD CODE. RIGHT NOW we only have 3 nodes in the launch file -- to edit you must alter multi-node-launch.py in the src>image_processing>launch folder. Add a new node there.



# INDIVIDUAL NODE LAUNCHES

# This command sets up all the dependencies to be able to launch nodes from the terminal

# See CAMERA_NOTES to be able to start the camera nodes for ros

# To start the node that takes in camera input and returns the location of blocks in terms of pixels run the below

## ros2 run image_processing cube_detect

# To start the node that takes this cube detect information and returns predicted locations in terms of x in and y in for red and green blocks run the below

## ros2 run image_processing cube_locate
